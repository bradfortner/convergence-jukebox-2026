## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Input Requirements

**This script REQUIRES a `record.jpg` file in the same directory to work.**

The master script (0.0) processes a photograph of a vinyl record and creates an animated spinning version. You must provide:
- **Filename**: `record.jpg`
- **Format**: JPG/JPEG image
- **Content**: A photograph of a vinyl record (preferably straight-on, clear view)
- **Location**: Same folder as the script

Without `record.jpg`, the script will not run successfully.

## How It Integrates with Convergence Jukebox 2026

### GUI Integration

The 45 RPM Spinning Record Animation module powers the animated popups in the GUI:

**Song Selection Popup** (`popup_45rpm_song_selection_code_module.py`)
- When a user selects a song from the A/B/C selection windows
- Calls this animation module to generate a record with the song title and artist
- Displays spinning record animation for ~10 seconds
- Provides visual confirmation of selection

**Now-Playing Popup** (`popup_45rpm_now_playing_code_module.py`)
- When playback transitions to a new song
- Generates a fresh 45 RPM record animation with current song info
- Updates the visual display in real-time
- Shows what's currently playing

### Player Integration

The player engine provides:
- Song metadata (title, artist)
- Playback status updates
- Paid vs. random song classification
- Real-time playlist changes

The GUI displays this information with animated records, making the jukebox visually engaging.

## Quick Start ‚≠ê

**Prerequisites:**
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Place your vinyl record photo as `record.jpg` in this folder
3. Run the pipeline

**Execute:**
```bash
python "0.0 - 45rpm_record_animation_from_real_label.py"
```

The script will automatically:
1. Create a vinyl record template (RIAA 45 RPM proportions)
2. Extract the record label from your photo
3. Fill the center hole with proper dimensions
4. Composite everything together
5. Display an animated spinning record

---

## What You Get

The pipeline generates three output files:
- `45rpm_proportional_template.png` - The vinyl record template (540x540 pixels)
- `transparent_45rpm_record_label.png` - Extracted label with transparency
- `final_record_pressing.png` - Composite final vinyl record

Plus a live animation window showing the record spinning at 15 FPS.

---

## Pipeline Overview

**v0.0 - 45rpm_record_animation_from_real_label.py** is the master orchestrator that combines five processing stages:

### 1. **create_vinyl_45_template_module()**
Creates a proportionally correct 45 RPM vinyl record template following RIAA specifications.
- Output: 540x540 pixel template with RGBA transparency

### 2. **extract_record_label_module()**
Detects circles in your photo using Hough Circle Detection and extracts the vinyl record label.
- Handles center hole detection with multiple fallback methods
- Output: 282x282 pixel label with transparent background

### 3. **fill_and_recut_center_hole_module()**
Detects edge color by sampling around the hole and fills the transparent center properly.
- Uses OpenCV floodFill for seamless filling
- Recuts proper 117-pixel diameter transparent center hole (RIAA spec)
- Output: Complete vinyl record with proper dimensions

### 4. **final_record_pressing_module()**
Composites the extracted label onto the vinyl template with proper alpha blending.
- Preserves all transparency
- Output: Final vinyl record image (540x540)

### 5. **display_record_playing_module()**
Opens a pygame window and displays the vinyl record spinning at 15 FPS.
- Rotates continuously until window is closed
- Animation speed: 360¬∞ per second (24¬∞ per frame)

---

## Requirements

```
Pillow (PIL) >= 9.0      # Image processing
opencv-python >= 4.5     # Circle detection, floodfill
numpy >= 1.20            # Array operations
scikit-image >= 0.19     # Image I/O
pygame >= 2.0            # Animation display
```

Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Python Usage

You can also use the pipeline programmatically:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent))

from RecordAnimationPipeline import RecordAnimationPipeline

# Create pipeline with your input image
pipeline = RecordAnimationPipeline(input_image_path="record.jpg")

# Run the complete pipeline
pipeline.run_pipeline()
```

### Integration with GUI

The GUI modules import and use this pipeline:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path(__file__).parent / "45_RPM_Spinning_Record_Animation"))

from RecordAnimationPipeline import RecordAnimationPipeline

# Generate record with song title and artist
def generate_record_for_song(title, artist):
    pipeline = RecordAnimationPipeline(input_image_path="record.jpg")

    # Run pipeline to generate spinning record
    pipeline.run_pipeline()

    # Overlay text with song title and artist
    # (Text rendering handled in GUI module)

    return "selection_45.gif"
```

## How It Works

### Image Processing Pipeline

**1. Circle Detection** (Hough Circle Detection)
- Converts input photo to grayscale
- Applies Gaussian blur
- Detects circles to find vinyl record in photo
- Extracts largest circle (the record)

**2. Center Hole Detection** (Multi-method approach)
- Tries contour-based circularity detection
- Falls back to Hough Circle Detection
- Falls back to dark spot detection
- Creates transparent hole with proper alpha channel

**3. Color Detection** (Ring sampling)
- Samples 360 points in a ring around the center hole
- Collects all non-transparent pixels
- Selects the brightest color
- Uses this color to fill the transparent hole

**4. FloodFill** (OpenCV cv2.floodFill)
- Seeds from center point
- Fills the transparent hole with detected color
- Ensures contiguous image in memory
- Validates seed point within bounds

**5. Compositing** (Alpha blending)
- Applies vinyl record body circular mask (540px diameter)
- Creates transparent background outside record
- Merges alpha channels properly
- Produces final composite image

**6. Animation** (Pygame rotation)
- Loads final composite image
- Rotates incrementally (24¬∞ per frame at 15 FPS)
- Displays in centered window
- Runs until window is closed

## Troubleshooting

### "No circles detected!"
- Ensure `record.jpg` shows a clear vinyl record
- Try a photo with better lighting
- Make sure the record is relatively centered and in focus

### Circle detected but not your record
- The script found a different circular object
- Try taking a closer photo of just the record
- Ensure the record is the largest circular object

### Center hole not detected
- The script tries three detection methods automatically
- If none work, it falls back gracefully
- The script will still complete but may have imperfect hole detection

### Pygame window won't open
- Ensure you have a display/monitor connected
- Check that pygame is installed correctly: `pip install --upgrade pygame`
- Try running in a different environment

### Process takes a long time
- Processing time depends on image resolution
- High-res photos (4K+) take longer to process
- This is normal; wait for completion

### ImportError when integrating with GUI
- Ensure the path to this module is correct in your import
- Verify `RecordAnimationPipeline.py` exists in this directory
- Check that all dependencies are installed in the same Python environment

## Development History

This project evolved through multiple versions:

- **v0.0**: Master pipeline - unified orchestration ‚≠ê **USE THIS**
- **v1.0-v5.1**: Individual processing stages (archived in depreciated_code/)

The master script consolidates all stages into a single coherent workflow with proper threading and error handling.

---

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Photo Quality**: Take a clear, well-lit photo of your vinyl record
2. **Angle**: Shoot straight-on (not at an angle)
3. **Background**: Plain background works best
4. **Resolution**: Decent resolution (1000x1000 minimum) helps with detection
5. **Record Condition**: Visible record details help with label extraction

---

## Integration with Other Modules

### GUI Renewal Integration
The GUI uses this module to generate record animations:
- Import path: `45_RPM_Spinning_Record_Animation/RecordAnimationPipeline.py`
- Used in: `popup_45rpm_song_selection_code_module.py`
- Used in: `popup_45rpm_now_playing_code_module.py`
- Frequency: Once per song selection or playback change

### Player Renewal Integration
The player engine provides metadata that gets displayed on the animated records:
- Song title and artist
- Play count and statistics
- Genre information
- Paid vs. random classification

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Processing Time**: 5-15 seconds depending on image resolution
- **Output Size**: ~540x540 pixels PNG files (~50-100KB each)
- **Memory Usage**: Minimal (~50-100MB during processing)
