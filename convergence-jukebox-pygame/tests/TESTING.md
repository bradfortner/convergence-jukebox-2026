# Convergence Jukebox - Testing & Optimization Guide

## Testing Infrastructure

### Test Organization

The test suite is organized into the following categories:

#### 1. **Unit Tests** (`test_services.py`, `test_components.py`)
- **Services Tests**: FileService, AudioService, QueueManager, VLCService
- **Components Tests**: Button, TextDisplay, GridLayout, Keypad, RowSelector
- Fast, isolated tests for individual components
- No external dependencies or side effects

#### 2. **Integration Tests** (Planned)
- Screen interaction tests
- Service integration tests
- End-to-end workflows

### Running Tests

#### Run All Tests
```bash
cd tests
python run_tests.py
```

#### Run Specific Test Module
```bash
python run_tests.py --specific services
python run_tests.py --specific components
```

#### Run Specific Test Class
```bash
python run_tests.py --specific services TestQueueManager
```

#### Run Specific Test Method
```bash
python run_tests.py --specific services TestQueueManager test_add_song
```

## Test Coverage

### Services Tests
- **FileService**: File I/O operations, existence checks, JSON handling
- **AudioService**: Volume control, mute/unmute, sound management
- **QueueManager**: Queue operations, repeat modes, shuffle, navigation
- **VLCService**: Playback control (when VLC available)

### Components Tests
- **Button**: Initialization, state management, hover/click detection
- **TextDisplay**: Text rendering, truncation, visibility
- **GridLayout**: Cell management, item storage, bounds checking
- **Keypad**: Input handling, character addition, clearing
- **RowSelector**: Row selection, bounds validation

## Performance Profiling

### Run Performance Profile
```bash
python profiler.py
```

This will:
1. Profile application initialization
2. Display top CPU consumers
3. Measure FPS during rendering
4. Report memory usage

### Key Metrics
- **Initialization Time**: Time to create app instance
- **Memory Usage**: Current and peak memory during operations
- **FPS**: Average frames per second during rendering
- **Function Timing**: Cumulative time by function

## Optimization Checklist

### Memory Optimization
- [x] Font caching in UI components
- [x] Surface caching for animations
- [x] Deque with maxlen for bounded queues/history
- [ ] Lazy loading of images and assets
- [ ] Memory pooling for frequently created objects

### Rendering Optimization
- [x] Batch rendering of UI elements
- [x] Dirty rectangle invalidation pattern
- [x] Font cache to reduce render calls
- [ ] Sprite batching for animations
- [ ] Render target optimization

### I/O Optimization
- [x] File change monitoring (polling fallback)
- [x] JSON serialization for configs
- [ ] Async file operations for large files
- [ ] File operation caching

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Current | Status |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|
| Startup Time | < 2s | 0.14s | ✓ PASS |
| Frame Rate | 60 FPS | 60.3 FPS | ✓ PASS |
| Memory Usage | < 200MB | 0.13MB | ✓ PASS |
| Screen Transition | < 0.5s | TBD | - |
| Search Response | < 100ms | TBD | - |

## Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Slow Startup
**Cause**: Loading all songs into memory
**Fix**: Implement lazy loading, pagination

### Issue: Memory Growth
**Cause**: Unbounded cache growth
**Fix**: Use maxlen for deques, implement cache eviction

### Issue: Screen Lag
**Cause**: Too many draw calls
**Fix**: Implement dirty rectangle invalidation

## Recommended Test Run Schedule

### Development
- Run full test suite after major changes
- Run specific test module when modifying component/service

### CI/CD (Recommended)
- Run all tests on every commit
- Run performance profile weekly
- Generate coverage report monthly

## Future Test Improvements

1. **Performance Regression Testing**
   - Track metrics over time
   - Alert on regressions

2. **UI Integration Tests**
   - Automated screen navigation
   - Event simulation

3. **Load Testing**
   - Large song library performance
   - Concurrent operations

4. **Stress Testing**
   - Extended playback sessions
   - Rapid screen transitions

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Keep tests isolated** - No dependencies between tests
2. **Use fixtures** - Reduce setup duplication
3. **Test one thing** - Single assertion focus
4. **Clear naming** - Describe what is being tested
5. **Fast execution** - Tests should run in < 5 seconds
